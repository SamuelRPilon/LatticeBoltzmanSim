This GitHub repository contains an efficient implementation of a lattice Boltzmann simulation in the programming language Julia. The simulation focuses on the collision of two stable fluids and leverages fast Fourier transforms (FFT) to significantly accelerate the computational speed.

## About Lattice Boltzmann Simulation
The lattice Boltzmann method is a powerful computational fluid dynamics technique that discretizes space and time into a lattice structure. It models fluid flow by simulating the movement and interaction of particles on this lattice. This approach allows for the simulation of complex fluid dynamics phenomena, such as fluid mixing and interface evolution.
